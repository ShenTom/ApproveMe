# ApproveMe
   
Have you ever had a task you want to do but requires others' approvals? Then, you go on Slack and ask the others. Some say yes, some say no and the replies are all over the chat conversation. What's even worse? If the task falls short, you may not even be able to dig up the replies of others!

ApproveMe is a Slack application that allows a user to send a request to tagged users to gauge their approvals. The main workflow would be as following:
* An user create a new request that needs to be approved by the tagged users.
* Then once the user submits a form about the request, the server will send a notification to the tagged users through a chatbot and ask for their responses.
* Once the tagged users respond to the request, it will be stored in the database. Then, anyone involed in this request at any time can just use the listing command or simply open up the front end web application to see the result.

No more miscommunication or scapegoating!
